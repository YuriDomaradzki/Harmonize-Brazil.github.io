CMASK
-----


Harmonize Brazil acquires CBERS-4 Surface Reflectance Image Collections containing a cloud mask called Cmask. Cmask uses 3 different pixel values to map *Clear*, a *Cloud* or *No data* pixels. For CBERS-4 Data Cubes the CMASK band is generated by compositing the existent Image Collection CMASK bands. In Harmonize Brazil CBERS-4 products these values are remapped to the same as other Harmonize Brazil products, as can be seen in the following Table:
