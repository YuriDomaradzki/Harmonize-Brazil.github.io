Nesse módulo os dados do projeto Harmonize Brazil (Harmonize Brazil) serão utilizando, por meio da linguagem R, no pacote de classificação e análise de séries temporais `SITS (Satellite Image Time Series Analysis for Earth Observation Data Cubes) <https://github.com/e-sensing/sits>`_.

Os códigos para acompanhamento do curso estão disponíveis na plataforma Kaggle nos links abaixo, mas os arquivos originais são mantidos e atualizados no repositório *Code-Gallery* no github do projeto (https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/code-gallery).
